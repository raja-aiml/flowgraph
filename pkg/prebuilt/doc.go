// Package prebuilt provides opinionated, ready-made FlowGraph templates
// ("prebuilts") for common patterns such as RAG, ReAct, multi-agent
// supervisors, tool orchestration, etc. Each prebuilt exposes a simple
// configuration and returns a buildable *flowgraph.Graph that you can run
// with the default runtime or customize as needed.
